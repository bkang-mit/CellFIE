# CellFIE: Cell-intrinsic pathway discovery framework with Functional, In-situ profiling Experiments

### Overview
This repo contains codes used for CellFIE manuscript. "src_network_analysis" folder contains codes used to generate networks and their related analysis and "src_image_analysis" folder contains codes related to image preprocessing and analysis

### Conda Environment Setup
1. src_network_analysis: create and activate conda environment with networks.yml
2. src_image_analysis: create and activate conda environment with imlab2.yml
3. image_preprocessing: follow a separate repo linked [here](https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/image-preprocessing) to perform image-preprocessing (Registration & Cell Pose segmentation)
